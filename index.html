      <div><h3>Hebrew Technology</h3>
      <span>Technology is different in Hebrew. Some technologies are uniquely Hebrew. Most of the world’s programming languages are English derived. Would programming in a Hebrew way be different? We explore the Hebrew paradigm of technology through events and other programming.</span></div>

      <span>With the advent of smart contracts, <a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/12/04/ethereum-in-practice-part-2-how-to-build-a-better-democracy-in-under-a-100-lines-of-code/">a new paradigm of law</a> is emerging in the world: Code==Law. This new paradigm is a lush frontier of questions and opportunities.
Ex: <a href="https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/109614/do-decentralized-arbitration-markets-satisfy-mitzvah-to-set-up-courts">Do decentralized arbitration markets satisfy mitzvah to set up courts??</a> Is an autonomous DeFi (decentralized) smart contract implementinng p2p lending required to have a heter iska?

        What is the point of technology if not to make a better world? What’s different about technology with this intentionality? How do we account for the impact of our technology in repairing the world?

        <b>Great people are the key to great work.</b> "Most of us at one time or another have been part of a great team, a group of people who functioned together in an extraordinary way—who trusted one another, who complemented one anothers’ strengths and compensated for one another’s limitations, who had common goals that were larger than individual goals, and who produced extraordinary results. I have met many people who have experienced this sort of profound teamwork . . . Many say that they have spent much of their life looking for that experience again."

      <div><h3>Angels + Funding</h3>
      <span>
         <b>Startups are hard.</b> Most founders can recount a time when a key backer made a critical difference. Having help from someone who's done it before can be like having an agent from the future sent back in time to help you realize it. Money doesn't hurt either.
      </span></div>
      <div><h3>Founder Support</h3>
      <span>
        <b>Startups are hard.</b> Wouldn't it be great if there were a supportive community of people who just "get it" and want to see you succeed on your journey just cuz? A pat on the back can make all the difference! Cheat codes don't hurt either.
      </span></div>
      <div><h3>Co-founder Dating</h3>
      <span>
        <b>Startups are hard.</b> But by yourself they're everything but impossible. And yet even with this as a known given, finding great people to do great work with is often harder than doing the work itself. What, then could be better than a community of hyperactive yentas all trained in game theory, mechanism design, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_marriage_problem"> Stable Marriage Problem</a>?
